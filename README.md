This was my first ever "bigger" data analytics project after learning a bit of Python.
I focudes on WHAT rather than HOW and the code would look different if I was to do this now.
I would certainly not recommmend using the code I used for getting the raw data from Parkrun website, because A) it won't work very well for you and B) it wasn't the most polite way to communicate with the website.
