This was my first ever "bigger" data analytics project after learning a bit of Python.
I focudes on WHAT rather than HOW and the colde woul look different if I was to do this now.
I would certainly not recommmend using the code I used for getting the data of Parkrun website, because A) it won't work very well for you and B) it wasn't the most polite way to communicate with the website.
